The purpose of this program is to read in a title of a scholarship and it will match the title with titles from a file. 
If the user want to add the title to the list of title, it will add the title to the file and can be used for future use.
Each title will have a refernce to an essay file, the user can acess this essay file if they wish to after searching for a title.
Searching for a scholarship can be very frustrating and sometime many of them are similar espically the one the require essays.
This program will hopefully make it much easier. All the commands and file searching is done through the terminal. 


GUI VERSION COMING SOON!!! (HOPEFULLY)
